            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>Josh studied percussion at Hendrix College, completing a double major in Music and Psychology. Furthering his education on Guitar with John Rankin and jazz drum set with Johnny Vidakovich, Josh obtained his Masters in Music Therapy from Loyola in New Orleans. First working in the BR General Hospital, Josh began using music to promote healing and deep, positive change by starting programs in the Burn Unit and COPD outpatient clinic, focusing on uniting breath and music. Josh then spent the next 2 years working in Hospice at Four Seasons in Asheville, while conducting research on the positive effects of group drumming for adults with Dementia. Deeply inspired by masters of all fields, Josh is an avid learner and reader in continual practice. He then went onto to study tech full-time, specializing in Front-End Development.
            <p>Josh has completed a 200-hour Permacultre Design Course at <a href="http://wildabundance.net">Wild Abundance</a> and was blessed to complete an advanced 50-hour silent meditation retreat at <a href="https://www.blooming-lotus-yoga.com/">Blooming Lotus</a> in Bali taught by Lily Gonclaves and Ramananda.</p>
